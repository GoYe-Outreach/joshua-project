    "Summary": "The Sindhi, named for the Sindhu River, are said to be one of the oldest people groups in South Asia. The Sindhi are native to the Sindh Province which is now in Pakistan. Their culture has been heavily influenced by Muslim beliefs and their customs reflect that. Though most Sindhi still live in India and Pakistan, others are scattered all over the world in places like Belize, Central America.",
    "ScriptureFocus": "Let your steadfast love, O LORD, be upon us, even as we hope in you.",
    "ScripturePrayer": "Pray for this people group to give their love and devotion to the Lord and be rewarded with hope and joy forever.",
    "ScriptureReference": "Psalm 33:22",
    "HowReach": "Talking to the Sindhi people and leading them to get to know people who believe firsthand, as well as encouraging usage of the resources, could be helpful in leading them to Jesus.",
    "Obstacles": "There are no known believers among the Sindhi and changing that has been difficult. However there are many resources available in their language, including the complete Bible, audio Bible recordings, the JESUS Film and other audio-visual Bible-centered materials.",
    "PrayForChurch": "There are no Sindhi believers in Belize that we know of.",
    "PrayForPG": "Pray for the physical and spiritual needs of the Sindhi of Belize to be met and for them to have strong, loving families. Pray for prayer teams to be lifted up to intercede for the Sindhi. Pray for an effective distribution of the gospel among those who lack it.",
